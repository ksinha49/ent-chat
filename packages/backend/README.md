# Backend

This directory contains the Python backend for ABACUS. The scripts are
placeholders that will be expanded as the service evolves.

## Setup

1. Navigate to this folder:

   ```bash
   cd packages/backend
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running

Activate your environment if you haven't already and run:

```bash
python main.py
```

The current scripts raise `NotImplementedError` until the backend logic
is implemented.
